# iOS 11 scroll offset bug

**TLDR; I fixed it (with [help](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-12886)), [click here](#moneyshot).**

I say iOS 11, I only noticed this bug after "fixing" a related bug, that as far as I'm aware is a result of a change in iOS 11, affecting web containers.

The related bug, a white strip where the status bar should be, first appeared to me when preparing a new release of [Flood Aware](http://flood-aware.k3r.me), for iOS 11. Flood Aware is built with [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/), and makes use of the [StatusBar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-statusbar) plugin. After building for iOS 11, the status bar became white and featureless. Turns out what was happening, was that the 20 pixels of web canvas, behind the status bar was now outside the default viewport. The white strip is actually the default white background of the html `body` element, and can still be affected by some CSS. For instance, colour, not images.

The prevailing advice seemed to be to add `viewport-fit=cover` to the 'viewport' meta tag, which did give me back me
back my status bar, by extending the viewport back to the top of the screen. The fix unfortunately introduced a weird offset bug, which wasn't obvious until after I released the latest version of Flood Aware. And not that obvious, it took me a while to track down the cause, helped in part by this [Jira thread](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-12886).

The offset bug manifests itself as a jump. A scrollable HTML element, decorated with `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`, renders correctly, initially. Then, after some interaction gains 20 pixels at the top of the element, creating a jump (presumably as a result of a redraw). Within Flood Aware, the easiest way to recreate the bug was by giving focus to a text input within a scrollable region. I've recreated the bug in the [master](https://github.com/kim3er/ios11-scroll-offset/tree/master) branch of this [repo](https://github.com/kim3er/ios11-scroll-offset). You can see below for an animated GIF of the bug, or follow the [install instructions](#install).

As you can see, as a result of the additional space, the cursor's position is skewed. Now I learnt a couple of things from the fore mentioned Jira ticket:

1. Looks like WebKit may have already identified and fixed the [bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175949). (Yay)
2. A suggestion that UIWebView is [deprecated](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-12886?focusedCommentId=16151408&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16151408), presumably by Apple, Cordova or both. (Not yay)

Switching Flood Aware to WKWebView isn't that big a deal, as it's a pretty simple app. But I can think of at least one other that is going to give me some grief! C'est la vie.

## The fix

So, what have I got for you, by way of a fix? Three additional branches, that's what.

### [wkwebview](https://github.com/kim3er/ios11-scroll-offset/tree/wkwebview)

The same as master branch, but with the [cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine) installed. There was some suggestion that the problem would be resolved by doing this. In fact it partially is, but you get a bar a the bottom of the page instead.

### [realworld](https://github.com/kim3er/ios11-scroll-offset/tree/realworld)

After accepting that there are degrees to this problem, I decided to create a branch that more closely reflected the Flood Aware environment.

1. Flood Aware uses images for the background.
2. The starting position did not include the viewport fix.

### [realworld-fix](https://github.com/kim3er/ios11-scroll-offset/tree/realworld-fix)<a name="moneyshot"></a>

The money shot. I embraced WKWebView (it seemed the only way to go), so re-added the plugin, and another called [cordova-plugin-ios11-inset-statusbar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova-plugin-ios11-inset-statusbar). The second is a super simple plugin that extends the viewport 20 pixels up, without need for the `viewport-fit` fix.

The offset bug is now gone, because the `viewport-fit` fix is gone. But, the bar at the bottom remains. To fix the bar at the bottom, I changed the height of the body element to `height: calc(100% + 20px);`. Voil√†!

1. Status bar is back.
2. Offset is gone.
3. Viewport extend to bottom of screen.
